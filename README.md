# StarlightHelpers

## Why

I needed common used methods when I'm programming websites in one place, not in /lib directories across more projects and with different updates. And this time I've added unit tests. Finally the feeling, that my code is falling apart, is gone.

And I'm sharing it with YOU! Enjoy.

## Usage

Read the source or tests. They are simple. Of course I add documentation later.

## Roadmap

- better rendering of the content (allow options for markdown), add textile, escape entities in plaintext
- add stylistic filters to the content renderer - change of quotes, remove double spaces and such eye candy things


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'starlight_helpers'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install starlight_helpers
